    <p>Hi, my name is Fatin Nurhusna binti Marzuki. I am 22 years old this year. I am currently studying at University Malaysia Perlis (Unimap). I am continuing my Bachelor's Degree in New Media Communication. I love my university journey so much! It is because I got the course that I want, I chose this course because of my dream career. My career goal is to work as a <strong> newsreader </strong>.
a profession that is essential to provide the public with timely, accurate, and objective information.  Presenting the most recent stories with clarity, assurance, and credibility is the responsibility of a newsreader, who frequently serves as the public face of a news show.  The significant impact newsreaders have on public consciousness is what drew me to this line of work.  From breaking news to significant local events, they assist consumers in keeping up with global events.  Newsreaders' daily interactions with viewers while maintaining professionalism, poise, and ethics inspire me.  One day, I hope to be in front of the camera, not only to report the news but also to establish myself as a community leader.</p>
